# Scoring system
{: .no_toc }

A compound of a microservice, its API, and a CLI.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .mb-7}

The Scoring System is based on the following pieces:

- [x] **Scoring Service** - The microservice that serves the API along with the other tools.
- [x] **Rulesets** - A compound of rules that can replace and extend the default rules already existing in the microservice.
- [x] **API CLI** - The CLI that interacts with the service from the terminal.
